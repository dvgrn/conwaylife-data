This folder contains the automation code that retrieved all the reasonable-sized rule table files
(posted inside code blocks, starting with @RULE) that were available on the conwaylife.com forums
as of 20 December 2019.

A 6.5MB ZIP file, All-loaded-rules-23Dec2019.zip, is also included. This can be decompressed into
Golly's Rules folder to enable simulation of (almost) all patterns posted to the conwaylife.com forums.
